        <h2>A little about my past</h2>
        <p>I grew up in Weldon Spring, Missouri. If I'm not mistaken(I know, right?), I was born in O'fallon,
            Missouri.
            My
            mother was 15 when she became pregnant with me.
            When I was two years old, she moved in with a man she had been seeing, and moved in with him and his
            parents.
            I've known him to be the most consistent
            fatherly image in my life to date. (And I will likely refer to him and his family as my own family from
            here
            on.)
        </p>

        <h3>Growing up.</h3>
        <p>
            My mother and her boyfriend would be considered low income. However, we typically were under fairly good
            circumstances due to my mothers boyfriends parents generally
            being the saving grace. This being the case, I feel like I came from a fairly unique situation in life.
            While, I
            generally was, by no means, considered "wealthy", we weren't
            quite poor either. I was spoiled quite frequently by my grandparents. Trust me, that has passed down to
            my
            daughter as well. Attending school in Weldon Spring, however, was
            not the most pleasant experience in my opinion. The schools are typically of pretty good quality. Crime
            is
            low.
            It's a good area. It's also heavily middle class or higher.
            Kids will be kids. Of course, being that my parents lived in a trailor, from the outside, my lower
            income
            family
            was evident. It's sad that this plagued me. Like a game
            of dominoes, however, as a young child, as soon as I showed a vulnerability, I then became an easy
            target
            for
            many kids to pick on. This started from day one of school, up
            until I left, in some form or another.

            I always loved video games. What kid of my generation didn't? However, I never really had a computer. My
            father
            was always interested in video games and technology.
            One would have thought that he would've shared that interest with me. That wasn't the case. My "first"
            computer
            was passed down to me by my Aunt. I couldn't tell you exactly
            what is was. Pretty positive it was a Windows 95. I think I was in middle school, so this would have
            been
            early
            2000's. I had no games for it. I had no internet. All I had
            was the built in games for windows, like pinball(which wasn't bad...) and solitaire. What did I do for
            hours
            on
            end though? I literally just explored through all of the files.
            Simply out of curiousity. Can't say that I ever really learned much from that or anything, but this was
            more
            or
            less my first experience with a computer and I got enjoyment
            out of essentially doing, well.... nothing with it.
        </p>
        <h3>First "real" computer</h3>
        <p>
            My first "real" computer was around the age of 15. I actually had the internet! Dial-up, of course. Yes,
            I
            spent
            a week downloading an album. Needless to say though, much
            of my learning came through messing a lot of things up first. Today, I often get by just fine without
            much
            of a
            risk of getting viruses. I typically run free anti-virus software,
            and I just know what I'm doing in the dangerous world of the internet. That intuition probably comes
            from
            having
            over 10,000 logged viruses the first time my computer
            crashed on me. I failed fast, and learned faster.
        </p>

        <h3>Dropping out and after...</h3>
        <p>I'd say that school was an obstacle to me. For the most part, when I applied myself, it was inevitable
            that I
            got
            straight A's. Even at times when I didn't try that hard,
            I still would astound teachers with my good grades. There was a time that I might have cried if I got a
            B(Maybe
            this actually happened in middle school). Well, being a kid
            who cared about their grades....isn't it inevitable that other kids would make pick on me for it? So
            being
            such
            a smart child, I thought...."Hey! If I get bad grades, I'll be
            accepted!." So, I intentially stopped trying in school. Heh.. Guess what? Now, I got picked on for being
            stupid.
            Let's just simplify things a little here. I wasn't gonna win
            the social game in school. I gave up. I regret it, but I gave up, and I stopped going.

        <h2>Where change began to creep in</h2>
        <p>Realistically, I never "knew" what I wanted to be when I grew up. The only real interest I ever had
            involved
            technology.
            For the most part though, everything about it always seemed to be so much like "magic". I didn't ever
            know
            where
            to start.
            I started working at 14 on a workers permit, washing dishes at my Mothers work. That lasted about as
            long as
            you'd expect for a 14 year old.
            Over the years, I picked up various jobs and made due with what I could. Eventually, I started working
            at
            Wal-Mart. I quickly moved up in positions
            which made the job feel pretty fresh. I started at $7.35 an hour, and within 2 years, I was making $11.
            I
            felt
            pretty good about myself.
            When I started as a cashier, I quickly prided myself in becoming one of the fastest checkers there. I
            had
            regulars who would come searching for me specifically just
            because they knew I would get them through the line. Eventually, I moved on to working at the customer
            service
            desk, and from there, supervising the front-end as a "CSM"(Customer
            Service Manager). Wal-Mart was actually a pretty decent company to work for. I had it's ups and downs
            just
            like
            any other company. Of course, they want to staff as little as
            possible, and put as much work as possible on as few people as they can. Most companies do this though.
            I
            got
            some half-way decent benefits. But what really stood out for me, is
            that if I worked hard....people recognized it, and I moved up. I constantly felt like I was improving.
            Not
            once
            at that job did I feel like I wasn't growing in some way. This is,
            in my opinion, a very valuable thing. Some people don't search for this. They just want to go in, do
            what
            they
            are told to do, and go home. I've always been one to seek out more.
        </p>
        <h3>Working as a locksmith</h3>
        <p>
            When I was 20 years old, I actually made contact with my biological father for the first time in my
            life.
            That's
            a story of its own, to be honest. As a synopsis however,
            it went well. I had known him for between 2 and 3 years when he called me and told me his job had an
            opening
            and
            that I could come work with him. He had been working as a locksmith
            for the past 12 years or so at this point. I was up for another promotion at Wal-Mart at the time, and
            was
            honestly not entirely sure what to do. I'm typically someone who gets
            comfortable and is fairly adverse to change. This time, I decided that this change could be for the
            good,
            and I
            liked the idea of the opportunity to work with my biological father
            and get to know him more.

            Taking this job, I had very little(pretty much 0) hands on experience with tools or really any kind. I
            would
            never consider myself "handy". However, I'd say that given enough time
            and practice, I became fairly decent. One thing though that I did realize, is that locksmithing was far
            from
            my
            dream job. I had a lot of issues with it as a profession. I very
            seldom felt the sense of progression. There were no other "positions" to move in to. There was no
            consistency to
            raises. No annual reviews. Nothing to really push me. I felt like
            no matter how hard I worked, my chances of getting a raise would be determined by a flip of a coin, if
            my
            boss
            remembered to flip the coin at all. After 5 years, I was making $13 an hour
            with 1 week vacation. However, at this point, I now had a child as well. I didn't like this trajectory
            anymore.

            While I don't regret working as a locksmith, as it gave me a ton of experience with things I other-wise
            would
            never have been exposed to, I definitely realize that it's not something
            I'm meant for.
        </p>
        <h3>Meeting ButterScotch</h3>
        <p>
            One day, during work, I was called out to rekey a home. This was a pretty standard residential call as a
            locksmith. Typically something that didn't take much time as long as
            the house wasn't too old. Being that I always had an underlying interest in technology, any time I was
            in a
            customers home who had some sort of unique computer setup,
            I would try to engage in conversation with them about it. That's pretty much what happened here,
            however, in
            a
            way that I didn't realize, it completely changed my life this time.
            I was going about my business, as usual, grabbing locks off the doors and taking them to my van so that
            I
            could
            key them up to a new set of keys for the customer. As I made my way to
            their finished basement, I notice several computer setups. Posters on the walls. And a general layout
            that
            definitely screamed, "Something's going on here." I don't remember any exact words
            but I mentioned something about the setup, and the owner of the house replied, "Yeah, we got a lot going
            on
            here." So, I'm here to do a job, so I went about my business and got it done.
            They looked busy, so I wasn't really looking to take up much of their time. As I was putting all the
            locks
            back
            on the doors, I heard them having some sort of meeting and it
            sounded much like they were discussing games. So as I approached them to collect on the bill, I inquired
            a
            little further. Didn't go too in-depth, but they told me that they were
            a local indie game studio called ButterScotch Shenanigans. I thought that was pretty cool. Of course, I
            know
            the
            market. It's flooded. There's a million "studios" out there working on
            games that may or may not ever see the light of day. Even if they do, actually selling and becoming
            popular?
            It's a competitive market. So I just asked them if they'd released a
            game at all. They replied all non-chalantly, briefly mentioning their latest game CrashLands. I asked if
            it'd
            done well or not. Of course, "Yeah, it's done okay we think."

            So, I finish up and go out to my van. I look these guys up, and I'll tell you what. In my personal
            opinion,
            they
            were being entirely way too humble. While they are still a small
            indie studio, they've done extremely well for themselves. I noticed they had a documentary out. They had
            a
            podcast with over 100 episodes, each about an hour long. Multiple talks
            about game development. A vast amount of information about them suddenly became a huge list of research
            that
            I
            just had to do.
        </p>
        <h3>Bordering on obsession</h3>
        <p>
            For the next month, I listened to every podcast they had released. I'd at least played each of their
            games
            for a
            decent amount of time. I'd listened to most of their
            talked available on the internet. I listened to every book that I could find an audio-book version of,
            that
            they
            had recommended to read. Slowly, through listening to them,
            how I viewed the world and myself began to change. They actually do professional game development using
            a
            game
            engine called Game Maker Studio. While, I had tried to toy around
            with a little bit of programming here and there, I'd always get stumped somewhere early on and give up.
            I
            never
            seemed to break the barrier in to understanding the fundamentals.
            Once I picked up Game Maker Studio, I did a handful of tutorials. While they do offer a "drag n' drop"
            style
            of
            programming, I never touched that. I went straight for their built-in
            scripting language, GML. This just made sense to me. Everything about it just worked and I felt like I
            never
            understand why programming was ever hard to understand in the past.
            From that day on, I've spent most of my free time programming in some form just about every day. I made
            a
            few
            "incomplete games" in Game Maker over a few weekends. I contacted
            ButterScotch Shenanigans again through email, and hoped that they remembered me. I informed them about
            how,
            after I left that day, I had researched to find out who they were, and
            how much of an influence they've had so far on my life. I humbly asked them if they'd be willing to meet
            me
            for
            coffee sometime, and they agreed. We actually spent like 3 hours at
            a local starbucks just talking about game development and stuff. Needless to say, I'm a permanent fan,
            and
            they
            continue to inspire me to this day.

        <h2>Where my inspiration has gotten me</h2>
        <p>
            After about 5-6 months toying with Game Maker Studio, I decided to take a shot at other programming
            languages. I
            messed around with C# for a little bit, and as I tried
            more and more to fit more learning in to my free-time, stress at work continued to build. More and more
            I
            would
            realize how much I didn't want to be doing what I was doing
            anymore. I started looking in to options. I never felt like I could leave work at work, and found it
            difficult
            to come home and do the things that I found interesting. I wanted
            to spend more time learning and less time struggling through that daily grind. I wished so much that I
            could
            go
            back in time and stayed in school. Well... I decided that I'd
            quit my job and do just that, minus the time-traveling.
        </p>
        <h3>Getting my GED</h3>
        <p>
        Having dropped out about 11 years prior, there was plenty that I did not remember about ...well, school
        period.
        I
        never took the GED because I didn't think I could actually
        pass. I probably shouldn't make this public knowledge, but it's pretty common for me to think that I can't
        do
        something. Trust me, imposter syndrome exists for me everywhere.
        Well, I took a couple weeks to brush up on math on Khan Academy, and did some very brief brushing up on
        other
        subjects. Scheduled it, and just took the test. ButterScotch Shenanigans
        has a little slogan that they throw aroung pretty often: "Ya just gotta get in there!" Well, I got in there,
        and
        I
        took the test. And I did great. I don't know exactly how the scoring
        works, they gave you a score out of a possible 20 points for each of the five subjects. I got 95 out of 20.
        It's
        hard for me to actually understand how good that is or if I should
        be proud. It's one thing to say that I got a great score, only to find out that just about anyone could do
        that
        well. So, I'm just happy that I passed. Once I finished my GED,
        I had actually planned on going through LaunchCode. However, I didn't know when the next class was going to
        be
        offered. So.. I'm at a college anyways, why not sign up for classes?
        So I did.
        </p>
        <h3>Going back to school at 27...</h3>
        <p>
        Being that I'm 27, intending on going through LaunchCode, and knowing that the industry is tending to put
        less
        emphasis on formal education, and more on applicable knowledge,
        I didn't want to spend 2-4 years getting a degree in Computer Science. I honestly wasn't sure about going
        through
        college at all. However, having just completed my GED, I figure
        some form of college education was bound to look better than just GED. Initially, I wanted to quit my job
        and
        just
        spend all my time teaching myself everything. However, when you quit
        your job and tell people that you stay at home all day teaching yourself to program....it just doesn't have
        the
        same
        sound as saying that you quit your job to go back to college.
        So I set myself up for a 6 month Certificate of Specialization in Computer Programming. It encompassed 18
        credit
        hours, skipping a lot of general education requirements. This was
        more or less ideal for me. I will say, being 27, it is very strange being back in a class room. However, I
        appreciate it so much more. Never in my life did I really ever anticipate
        that I would have stepped foot in a college class room. But there I was.
        </p>
        <h3>Starting LaunchCode</h3>
        <p>
        My general structure of my college classes was basically three sets of two classes, each taken at
        half-semester
        lengths. So, instead of 16 week full-semester classes, they were
        the same classes, but done in 8 weeks. Two classes at a time. I ended up getting an email about LaunchCode
        starting
        in January, 2019. That's also when my last set of college classes
        started. If I didn't take this opportunity, then I didn't know when LaunchCode would be offering classes
        again.
        So,
        I figured I'd just have to handle both, which seemed feasable as
        I'd be taking the easiest section of LaunchCode coupled with the hardest section of my college courses, and
        after
        that, I'd be free to focus on LaunchCode.
        It is important to note, that even though I did quit my job just before starting college, I ended up picking
        up
        a
        part-time job in sales(Ironically, wholesale distribution of door hardware to locksmiths)
        shortly after the fact. So I was still balancing 20+ hours at work, "full-time" college, and LaunchCode at
        the
        same
        time.
        </p>
        <h3>Finishing Certificate at SCC</h3>
        <p>
        At the time of writing this, I actually only finished my college courses a week or two ago. It's a huge
        weight
        off
        my shoulders, but it definitely feels strange. I have definitely
        learned a lot, but I do think it's fairly difficult to gauge yourself and where you are, when you don't
        always
        know
        exactly where you should be. That's one thing that I always
        also struggle with. I always want to know how I compare, because if I don't have anything to compare to,
        then I
        don't know if I am doing okay? It's a problem, but at the same time,
        it's often my driving force to become better. I have learned a ton about programming, but at the same time,
        I
        feel
        like that knowledge has only opened doors to so many more questions
        than was answered. The more I know, the more I realize I don't know, right? And that's okay though. I'm
        finished
        with my college portion of education, which conveniently covered a
        fair amount of stuff that LaunchCode probably won't touch on. While, at the same time, LaunchCode will be
        touching
        on a whole lot of stuff that the college courses didn't. My hope is
        that with the combination of the two, I will be able to stand out and become competent enough to make my way
        in
        to
        the industry.
        </p>
        <h3>4.0 GPA and making the deans list</h3>
        <p>Another accomplishment that I feel is difficult to gauge. I'm excited and happy, as someone who dropped
            out
            of
            high school so long ago,
            recently got their GED and just jumped in to all of this, I did finish the 18 credit hour certificate
            with a
            4.0
            GPA, and made the Dean's List. Granted that it's a
            community college, and I feel like the grading for the most part was pretty relaxed, I don't know if
            this is
            something I should be proud of? I am happy none-the-less.
            Mostly, I'm just proud of myself for setting out and doing something like this, and finishing it. I'll
            be
            doing
            the same with LaunchCode. And hopefully, from here on out,
            everything else I aim to accomplish in my life.

        <h2>Where I dream to go</h2>
        <h3>Personal motivation and inspiration</h3>
        <p>
            My initial inspiration was a combination of unhappiness of where I found myself in life, and meeting a
            group
            of
            people who inspired me to become more. My driving inspiration and
            motivation however, is my daughter. She's 4 years old, and I need to do more. More for her financially.
            More
            for
            her mentally and emotionally. Even though I am busy a lot now, so
            I don't get to spend as much time with her, that's only short term. My aim is to show her that if you
            want
            to do
            something, that you can go out and make it happen. I did unfortunately
            follow the footsteps of my parents and dropped out of school, finding work in whatever job was hiring at
            the
            time. It's one thing when your parents tell you to stay in school.
            My parents told me to learn from their mistakes. I still did as they did, rather than as they said.
            Action
            speaks louder than words. I need to show my daughter that you can
            make a better life for yourself if you put in the work for it. I want to support her in her interests as
            she
            grows and I want to allow her to find her talents and passion.
            I want her to be able to find the motivation and inspiration to do the things she wants to do in life,
            without
            struggling like I did.
        </p>
        <h3>Short term and long term goals</h3>
        <p>
            Initially, I got inspired through video games, and specifically a video game studio. However, I'm aware
            of
            what
            the industry is like. If, one day, I could form a small studio and do games,
            or become part of a small studio, that'd be great. However, my goal is to break in to the industry as an
            entry
            level web developer. From there, I'd love to explore and learn as much as
            I can and branch off as I specialize in my interests. I actually have an underlying interest in
            hardware.
            I'd
            love to learn more about it. Unfortunately, for now, it's one step at
            a time. And that's one thing that's absolutely fantastic about this industry. There are so many
            different
            directions you can go and there's always something new you can learn.
