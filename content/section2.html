            <h3>Where change began to creep in</h3>
            <p>Realistically, I never "knew" what I wanted to be when I grew up. The only real interest I ever had
                involved
                technology.
                For the most part though, everything about it always seemed to be so much like "magic". I didn't ever
                know
                where
                to start.
                I started working at 14 on a workers permit, washing dishes at my Mothers work. That lasted about as
                long as
                you'd expect for a 14 year old.
                Over the years, I picked up various jobs and made due with what I could. Eventually, I started working
                at
                Wal-Mart. I quickly moved up in positions
                which made the job feel pretty fresh. I started at $7.35 an hour, and within 2 years, I was making $11.
                I
                felt
                pretty good about myself.
                When I started as a cashier, I quickly prided myself in becoming one of the fastest checkers there. I
                had
                regulars who would come searching for me specifically just
                because they knew I would get them through the line. Eventually, I moved on to working at the customer
                service
                desk, and from there, supervising the front-end as a "CSM"(Customer
                Service Manager). Wal-Mart was actually a pretty decent company to work for. I had it's ups and downs
                just
                like
                any other company. Of course, they want to staff as little as
                possible, and put as much work as possible on as few people as they can. Most companies do this though.
                I
                got
                some half-way decent benefits. But what really stood out for me, is
                that if I worked hard....people recognized it, and I moved up. I constantly felt like I was improving.
                Not
                once
                at that job did I feel like I wasn't growing in some way. This is,
                in my opinion, a very valuable thing. Some people don't search for this. They just want to go in, do
                what
                they
                are told to do, and go home. I've always been one to seek out more.

            <h3>Working as a locksmith</h3>
            <p>
                When I was 20 years old, I actually made contact with my biological father for the first time in my
                life.
                That's
                a story of its own, to be honest. As a synopsis however,
                it went well. I had known him for between 2 and 3 years when he called me and told me his job had an
                opening
                and
                that I could come work with him. He had been working as a locksmith
                for the past 12 years or so at this point. I was up for another promotion at Wal-Mart at the time, and
                was
                honestly not entirely sure what to do. I'm typically someone who gets
                comfortable and is fairly adverse to change. This time, I decided that this change could be for the
                good,
                and I
                liked the idea of the opportunity to work with my biological father
                and get to know him more.

                Taking this job, I had very little(pretty much 0) hands on experience with tools or really any kind. I
                would
                never consider myself "handy". However, I'd say that given enough time
                and practice, I became fairly decent. One thing though that I did realize, is that locksmithing was far
                from
                my
                dream job. I had a lot of issues with it as a profession. I very
                seldom felt the sense of progression. There were no other "positions" to move in to. There was no
                consistency to
                raises. No annual reviews. Nothing to really push me. I felt like
                no matter how hard I worked, my chances of getting a raise would be determined by a flip of a coin, if
                my
                boss
                remembered to flip the coin at all. After 5 years, I was making $13 an hour
                with 1 week vacation. However, at this point, I now had a child as well. I didn't like this trajectory
                anymore.

                While I don't regret working as a locksmith, as it gave me a ton of experience with things I other-wise
                would
                never have been exposed to, I definitely realize that it's not something
                I'm meant for.

            <h3>Meeting ButterScotch</h3>
            <p>
                One day, during work, I was called out to rekey a home. This was a pretty standard residential call as a
                locksmith. Typically something that didn't take much time as long as
                the house wasn't too old. Being that I always had an underlying interest in technology, any time I was
                in a
                customers home who had some sort of unique computer setup,
                I would try to engage in conversation with them about it. That's pretty much what happened here,
                however, in
                a
                way that I didn't realize, it completely changed my life this time.
                I was going about my business, as usual, grabbing locks off the doors and taking them to my van so that
                I
                could
                key them up to a new set of keys for the customer. As I made my way to
                their finished basement, I notice several computer setups. Posters on the walls. And a general layout
                that
                definitely screamed, "Something's going on here." I don't remember any exact words
                but I mentioned something about the setup, and the owner of the house replied, "Yeah, we got a lot going
                on
                here." So, I'm here to do a job, so I went about my business and got it done.
                They looked busy, so I wasn't really looking to take up much of their time. As I was putting all the
                locks
                back
                on the doors, I heard them having some sort of meeting and it
                sounded much like they were discussing games. So as I approached them to collect on the bill, I inquired
                a
                little further. Didn't go too in-depth, but they told me that they were
                a local indie game studio called ButterScotch Shenanigans. I thought that was pretty cool. Of course, I
                know
                the
                market. It's flooded. There's a million "studios" out there working on
                games that may or may not ever see the light of day. Even if they do, actually selling and becoming
                popular?
                It's a competitive market. So I just asked them if they'd released a
                game at all. They replied all non-chalantly, briefly mentioning their latest game CrashLands. I asked if
                it'd
                done well or not. Of course, "Yeah, it's done okay we think."

                So, I finish up and go out to my van. I look these guys up, and I'll tell you what. In my personal
                opinion,
                they
                were being entirely way too humble. While they are still a small
                indie studio, they've done extremely well for themselves. I noticed they had a documentary out. They had
                a
                podcast with over 100 episodes, each about an hour long. Multiple talks
                about game development. A vast amount of information about them suddenly became a huge list of research
                that
                I
                just had to do.
            </p>
            <h3>Bordering on obsession</h3>
            <p>
                For the next month, I listened to every podcast they had released. I'd at least played each of their
                games
                for a
                decent amount of time. I'd listened to most of their
                talked available on the internet. I listened to every book that I could find an audio-book version of,
                that
                they
                had recommended to read. Slowly, through listening to them,
                how I viewed the world and myself began to change. They actually do professional game development using
                a
                game
                engine called Game Maker Studio. While, I had tried to toy around
                with a little bit of programming here and there, I'd always get stumped somewhere early on and give up.
                I
                never
                seemed to break the barrier in to understanding the fundamentals.
                Once I picked up Game Maker Studio, I did a handful of tutorials. While they do offer a "drag n' drop"
                style
                of
                programming, I never touched that. I went straight for their built-in
                scripting language, GML. This just made sense to me. Everything about it just worked and I felt like I
                never
                understand why programming was ever hard to understand in the past.
                From that day on, I've spent most of my free time programming in some form just about every day. I made
                a
                few
                "incomplete games" in Game Maker over a few weekends. I contacted
                ButterScotch Shenanigans again through email, and hoped that they remembered me. I informed them about
                how,
                after I left that day, I had researched to find out who they were, and
                how much of an influence they've had so far on my life. I humbly asked them if they'd be willing to meet
                me
                for
                coffee sometime, and they agreed. We actually spent like 3 hours at
                a local starbucks just talking about game development and stuff. Needless to say, I'm a permanent fan,
                and
                they
                continue to inspire me to this day.
