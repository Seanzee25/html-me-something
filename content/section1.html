            <h2>A little about my past</h2>
            <p>I grew up in Weldon Spring, Missouri. If I'm not mistaken(I know, right?), I was born in O'fallon,
                Missouri.
                My
                mother was 15 when she became pregnant with me.
                When I was two years old, she moved in with a man she had been seeing, and moved in with him and his
                parents.
                I've known him to be the most consistent
                fatherly image in my life to date. (And I will likely refer to him and his family as my own family from
                here
                on.)
            </p>

            <h3>Growing up.</h3>
            <p>
                My mother and her boyfriend would be considered low income. However, we typically were under fairly good
                circumstances due to my mothers boyfriends parents generally
                being the saving grace. This being the case, I feel like I came from a fairly unique situation in life.
                While, I
                generally was, by no means, considered "wealthy", we weren't
                quite poor either. I was spoiled quite frequently by my grandparents. Trust me, that has passed down to
                my
                daughter as well. Attending school in Weldon Spring, however, was
                not the most pleasant experience in my opinion. The schools are typically of pretty good quality. Crime
                is
                low.
                It's a good area. It's also heavily middle class or higher.
                Kids will be kids. Of course, being that my parents lived in a trailor, from the outside, my lower
                income
                family
                was evident. It's sad that this plagued me. Like a game
                of dominoes, however, as a young child, as soon as I showed a vulnerability, I then became an easy
                target
                for
                many kids to pick on. This started from day one of school, up
                until I left, in some form or another.

                I always loved video games. What kid of my generation didn't? However, I never really had a computer. My
                father
                was always interested in video games and technology.
                One would have thought that he would've shared that interest with me. That wasn't the case. My "first"
                computer
                was passed down to me by my Aunt. I couldn't tell you exactly
                what is was. Pretty positive it was a Windows 95. I think I was in middle school, so this would have
                been
                early
                2000's. I had no games for it. I had no internet. All I had
                was the built in games for windows, like pinball(which wasn't bad...) and solitaire. What did I do for
                hours
                on
                end though? I literally just explored through all of the files.
                Simply out of curiousity. Can't say that I ever really learned much from that or anything, but this was
                more
                or
                less my first experience with a computer and I got enjoyment
                out of essentially doing, well.... nothing with it.
            </p>
            <h3>First "real" computer</h3>
            <p>
                My first "real" computer was around the age of 15. I actually had the internet! Dial-up, of course. Yes,
                I
                spent
                a week downloading an album. Needless to say though, much
                of my learning came through messing a lot of things up first. Today, I often get by just fine without
                much
                of a
                risk of getting viruses. I typically run free anti-virus software,
                and I just know what I'm doing in the dangerous world of the internet. That intuition probably comes
                from
                having
                over 10,000 logged viruses the first time my computer
                crashed on me. I failed fast, and learned faster.
            </p>

            <h3>Dropping out and after...</h3>
            <p>I'd say that school was an obstacle to me. For the most part, when I applied myself, it was inevitable
                that I
                got
                straight A's. Even at times when I didn't try that hard,
                I still would astound teachers with my good grades. There was a time that I might have cried if I got a
                B(Maybe
                this actually happened in middle school). Well, being a kid
                who cared about their grades....isn't it inevitable that other kids would make pick on me for it? So
                being
                such
                a smart child, I thought...."Hey! If I get bad grades, I'll be
                accepted!." So, I intentially stopped trying in school. Heh.. Guess what? Now, I got picked on for being
                stupid.
                Let's just simplify things a little here. I wasn't gonna win
                the social game in school. I gave up. I regret it, but I gave up, and I stopped going.
