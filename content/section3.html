    <h3>Where my inspiration has gotten me</h3>
    <p>
        After about 5-6 months toying with Game Maker Studio, I decided to take a shot at other programming languages. I
        messed around with C# for a little bit, and as I tried
        more and more to fit more learning in to my free-time, stress at work continued to build. More and more I would
        realize how much I didn't want to be doing what I was doing
        anymore. I started looking in to options. I never felt like I could leave work at work, and found it difficult
        to come home and do the things that I found interesting. I wanted
        to spend more time learning and less time struggling through that daily grind. I wished so much that I could go
        back in time and stayed in school. Well... I decided that I'd
        quit my job and do just that, minus the time-traveling.
    </p>
    <h6>Getting my GED</h6>
    Having dropped out about 11 years prior, there was plenty that I did not remember about ...well, school period. I
    never took the GED because I didn't think I could actually
    pass. I probably shouldn't make this public knowledge, but it's pretty common for me to think that I can't do
    something. Trust me, imposter syndrome exists for me everywhere.
    Well, I took a couple weeks to brush up on math on Khan Academy, and did some very brief brushing up on other
    subjects. Scheduled it, and just took the test. ButterScotch Shenanigans
    has a little slogan that they throw aroung pretty often: "Ya just gotta get in there!" Well, I got in there, and I
    took the test. And I did great. I don't know exactly how the scoring
    works, they gave you a score out of a possible 20 points for each of the five subjects. I got 95 out of 20. It's
    hard for me to actually understand how good that is or if I should
    be proud. It's one thing to say that I got a great score, only to find out that just about anyone could do that
    well. So, I'm just happy that I passed. Once I finished my GED,
    I had actually planned on going through LaunchCode. However, I didn't know when the next class was going to be
    offered. So.. I'm at a college anyways, why not sign up for classes?
    So I did.
    <h6>Going back to school at 27...</h6>
    Being that I'm 27, intending on going through LaunchCode, and knowing that the industry is tending to put less
    emphasis on formal education, and more on applicable knowledge,
    I didn't want to spend 2-4 years getting a degree in Computer Science. I honestly wasn't sure about going through
    college at all. However, having just completed my GED, I figure
    some form of college education was bound to look better than just GED. Initially, I wanted to quit my job and just
    spend all my time teaching myself everything. However, when you quit
    your job and tell people that you stay at home all day teaching yourself to program....it just doesn't have the same
    sound as saying that you quit your job to go back to college.
    So I set myself up for a 6 month Certificate of Specialization in Computer Programming. It encompassed 18 credit
    hours, skipping a lot of general education requirements. This was
    more or less ideal for me. I will say, being 27, it is very strange being back in a class room. However, I
    appreciate it so much more. Never in my life did I really ever anticipate
    that I would have stepped foot in a college class room. But there I was.
    <h6>Starting LaunchCode</h6>
    My general structure of my college classes was basically three sets of two classes, each taken at half-semester
    lengths. So, instead of 16 week full-semester classes, they were
    the same classes, but done in 8 weeks. Two classes at a time. I ended up getting an email about LaunchCode starting
    in January, 2019. That's also when my last set of college classes
    started. If I didn't take this opportunity, then I didn't know when LaunchCode would be offering classes again. So,
    I figured I'd just have to handle both, which seemed feasable as
    I'd be taking the easiest section of LaunchCode coupled with the hardest section of my college courses, and after
    that, I'd be free to focus on LaunchCode.
    It is important to note, that even though I did quit my job just before starting college, I ended up picking up a
    part-time job in sales(Ironically, wholesale distribution of door hardware to locksmiths)
    shortly after the fact. So I was still balancing 20+ hours at work, "full-time" college, and LaunchCode at the same
    time.
    <h6>Finishing Certificate at SCC</h6>
    At the time of writing this, I actually only finished my college courses a week or two ago. It's a huge weight off
    my shoulders, but it definitely feels strange. I have definitely
    learned a lot, but I do think it's fairly difficult to gauge yourself and where you are, when you don't always know
    exactly where you should be. That's one thing that I always
    also struggle with. I always want to know how I compare, because if I don't have anything to compare to, then I
    don't know if I am doing okay? It's a problem, but at the same time,
    it's often my driving force to become better. I have learned a ton about programming, but at the same time, I feel
    like that knowledge has only opened doors to so many more questions
    than was answered. The more I know, the more I realize I don't know, right? And that's okay though. I'm finished
    with my college portion of education, which conveniently covered a
    fair amount of stuff that LaunchCode probably won't touch on. While, at the same time, LaunchCode will be touching
    on a whole lot of stuff that the college courses didn't. My hope is
    that with the combination of the two, I will be able to stand out and become competent enough to make my way in to
    the industry.
    <h6>4.0 GPA and making the deans list</h6>
    <p>Another accomplishment that I feel is difficult to gauge. I'm excited and happy, as someone who dropped out of
        high school so long ago,
        recently got their GED and just jumped in to all of this, I did finish the 18 credit hour certificate with a 4.0
        GPA, and made the Dean's List. Granted that it's a
        community college, and I feel like the grading for the most part was pretty relaxed, I don't know if this is
        something I should be proud of? I am happy none-the-less.
        Mostly, I'm just proud of myself for setting out and doing something like this, and finishing it. I'll be doing
        the same with LaunchCode. And hopefully, from here on out,
        everything else I aim to accomplish in my life.
