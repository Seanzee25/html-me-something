            <h3>Where I dream to go</h3>
            <h3>Personal motivation and inspiration</h3>
            <p>
                My initial inspiration was a combination of unhappiness of where I found myself in life, and meeting a
                group
                of
                people who inspired me to become more. My driving inspiration and
                motivation however, is my daughter. She's 4 years old, and I need to do more. More for her financially.
                More
                for
                her mentally and emotionally. Even though I am busy a lot now, so
                I don't get to spend as much time with her, that's only short term. My aim is to show her that if you
                want
                to do
                something, that you can go out and make it happen. I did unfortunately
                follow the footsteps of my parents and dropped out of school, finding work in whatever job was hiring at
                the
                time. It's one thing when your parents tell you to stay in school.
                My parents told me to learn from their mistakes. I still did as they did, rather than as they said.
                Action
                speaks louder than words. I need to show my daughter that you can
                make a better life for yourself if you put in the work for it. I want to support her in her interests as
                she
                grows and I want to allow her to find her talents and passion.
                I want her to be able to find the motivation and inspiration to do the things she wants to do in life,
                without
                struggling like I did.
            </p>
            <h3>Short term and long term goals</h3>
            <p>
                Initially, I got inspired through video games, and specifically a video game studio. However, I'm aware
                of
                what
                the industry is like. If, one day, I could form a small studio and do games,
                or become part of a small studio, that'd be great. However, my goal is to break in to the industry as an
                entry
                level web developer. From there, I'd love to explore and learn as much as
                I can and branch off as I specialize in my interests. I actually have an underlying interest in
                hardware.
                I'd
                love to learn more about it. Unfortunately, for now, it's one step at
                a time. And that's one thing that's absolutely fantastic about this industry. There are so many
                different
                directions you can go and there's always something new you can learn.
